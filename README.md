# Password Generator
Small script that generates a password that satisfies the conditions (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, numbers) based on an easier, universal one.
(basically a seemingly random ascii string of printable characters)

Examples:
``` 
python3 pass_gen.py yahoo
Your bad password: password
Your password:

P)BIMO:3p8

```

`password` can be cracked instantly using wordlists.
`P)BIMO:3p8` can be cracked in 53 years (tested [here](https://howsecureismypassword.net/))
