# Password Generator
Small script that generates a password that satisfies the conditions (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, numbers) based on an easier, universal one.
(basically a seemingly random ascii string of printable characters)

Examples:
``` 
python3 pass_gen.py yahoo password
P)BIMO:3p8

python3 pass_gen.py freecodecamp password
=:??AE=0:)GJa12

python3 pass_gen.py www.github.com password
N?QeE?M3L*e=MCn14
 
```

Passwords were tested [here](http://www.passwordmeter.com)

 Any contribution/criticism is welcome :grimacing:
